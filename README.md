## Description
Tired of spending money on note cards or downloading similar apps that ask for your private information like location? Too often, we have a tendency to put off mundane tasks and say we'll do it later, just to end up forgetting. Studying is no exception.

Note Text aims to solve these problems by providing a user friendly alternative that lets users create, edit, and review sets of flashcards, all without putting your personal information at risk. It also includes a built-in timer that the user can set for up to 24 hours. Once the time is up, the app will push a notification reminding the user to review that certain set!

This app strives to put an end to procrastination and help users become more disciplined. v2.1 is now available for download in the Amazon app store!

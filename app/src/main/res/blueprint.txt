Here are some features that need to be implemented:

*Basic activity that goes through all the flash cards
*Save feature that keeps all the data even after exiting the app
*Menu system that allows us to choose the different sets of flashcards
*Search feature for the toolbar to search through the cards
*Upload photo feature to put onto the cards
*Notification feature that reminds us to study at the time set by the user
*Transition animations when switching activities

Bugs that need to be fixed
-edit text boxes: texts cant be all on one line. Need to have 3 lines max at a time.
 each line needs to fit within the box. Should be able to scroll up/down if more than
 three lines so that it shows 3 at a time.
